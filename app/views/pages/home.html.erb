  <h3>Papatoo is a work in progress</h3>
    <p>
      Papatoo is a blog by a developer and father. The aim is to share some experiences to other parents,
      provide an article writing plateforme and a couple of features such as <%= link_to 'Locations', locations_path %>.
      Locations is a map and chat feature where you can share a location where you intend to be be for an activity and where you
      are open to people joining you on that activity. For example, as a father, I often go to the park and
      wished it would be possible to share that info with other fathers in the local community so that our kids could
      have a play together.
      However, that could work for dog walking, outdoor exercise, book sharing.... Anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, feel free to create an account, write an article, share a location, contact someone on the Locations map!
